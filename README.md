# Weather-APP

 The app leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve accurate weather information.

🔍 When you input a city and hit "Get Weather," the app makes an API request to fetch weather details like temperature and humidity. The data is dynamically displayed on the screen, including the city name, current temperature in Celsius, humidity percentage, and weather description.

📊 The app's interactive interface showcases the power of data fetching using JavaScript and APIs, providing valuable insights into frontend development and API integration.
